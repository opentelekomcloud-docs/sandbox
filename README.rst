Initializing a repo
===================


These steps are necessary to initialize a project repo enabling
you to contribute to the documentation of that project:

1. Log into GitHub with your credentials.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

2. Open the project on GitHub in your browser, for example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://github.com/opentelekomcloud-docs/sandbox

3. Create a "Fork" of the repo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   
Click on "Fork" on the top-right of the page. If you have several
identities configured, select the one you want to use for
contributing to the documentation.

|image1|

After succesful fork you should see a forked project under
your private identity.

|image2|

4. Change content of the documents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Edit the files with an "rst" extension to reflect your additions or
changes to the documentation. The root node of the documentation is
in "index.rst". Make sure that all restructured text files are
linked from this root node, since Sphinx will complain
otherwise.

|image3|

5. Commit the changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Commit the changes either to the main branch of your forked project or
in case of potential multiple independent changes you can push it
to separate branch.

|image4|

6. Create a Pull Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you succesfully pushed all your changes to your forked project
you are ready to create a pull request to the upstream project

|image5|

During creation of pull request you can quickly review your changes
which will be included in PR and if there are no conflicts you see
"Able to merge" green message.

|image6|

In next step you can assign reviewer to your changes, you can describe
what has been changed in PR description and proceed with PR.
In case you are not fully ready with all your changes but you
would like to see rendered web result you can create draft pull request.

|image7|

7. Review process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The review phase starts. Now two things happen in parallel: The
automated and the manual review. Let's first look into the
automated checks:
Under "Checks" tab of pull request you can find the progress of
the automated review jobs. Zuul is instantly simulating to merge your
changes and build the whole project. If build succeeded you can navigate
to respective "build" link and observe created artifacts.

|image8|

For your connvience Zuul is pre-rending html documentation
incorporating your changes under "Docs preview site" link.

|image9|

8. Check rendered preview of the changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Navigate to the modified content of the rendered documentation to validate
whether your changes are correct.

|image10|

9.  Check failed jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If, however, Zuul and Sphinx are not able to build the
project successfully, several red stop signs appear. To
investigate for the cause, identify the symbol for " checks have
failed" and click on "Details" right next to it. In the main
section of the new screen is a headline "Summary". Under that
there's probably a red cross stating "FAILURE", the time Zuul
needed to perform the checks, and a link. Click on it.

You now see a job detail page generated by Zuul. There's lots of
information about the job and Zuul's configuration, but we are
interested only in the 'Logs' tab on the lower part of the
screen. In the tab there's a long file 'job-output.txt', that
details all steps the Zuul performed to verify your changes: It
creates some compute resources, installs all necessary software,
checks out the repository including your changes, and starts the
build process. You should watch out for a message 'Running Sphinx
vX.Y.Z'. A few lines later there's usually the error listed, just
before the next 'ERROR' line. Depending on the type of the error,
the important information might be in another line, though.

10. Fixing issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you found the cause of the failed check, return to your local
repository, and fix it.

11. Peer review
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the meantime, the manual review phase has started. TODO Add screenshot
how to request changes by reviewer.

12. Merge Pull request - publish changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the project agrees that the change set is ready to be merged,
someone has to put the label "gate" to the commit. To do so, open
the PR, select the "Conversation" tab, and locate the "Labels"
section on the right-hand sidebar. Click on the tiny wheel and
select the "gate" label.

13. Useful links
